    Right after getting my <i>Baccalauréat ES with honours</i> in 2012, I started following a licence called
    <BaseLink alt="Humanités Licence website" href="https://humanites.parisnanterre.fr/" is-primary>
      "Humanités"
    </BaseLink> which basically brings five licences in one : <i>Philosophy, French Letters, History, Latin and English</i>.
    <br><br>I've learnt many things throughout my "Humanités" journey but I soon realised that I didn't see myself as a teacher or librairian.
    <br><br>The Internet had always had my attention so I dove right into it. I started coding my personal website for fun and soon began attending a web school called <BaseLink alt="IIM website" href="https://www.iim.fr/" is-primary>
      Institut de l'Internet et du Multimédia
    </BaseLink> (IIM) based in Paris, La Défense. Though that school provided a formation mainly focused on digital project management, I prefered programming. You'll find more info on my
    <BaseLink alt="Linkedin profile" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/antoinepiche/" is-primary>
      Linkedin profile
    </BaseLink>.
    <br><br>Since then I've kept improving my skills by teaching myself through Medium articles, documentation reading and online courses (Udemy, Elephorm).
    <br>I'm really committed to my work, learning new things is what really keeps me motivated and I'm obsessed with clean, readable and optimized code.
    I'm currently working on my back-end skills (and loving it), I'm learning Go and I keep working with Vue.js (or Nuxt.js), of course.
